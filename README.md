Welcome to my Etch-a-Sketch project. This was a JavaScript lab exercise on my CodeClan course, to learn the wonders of canvas.
I have made some modifications and it's still a work in progress.

So far you can:

- free draw with the mouse
- free draw with the up/down/left/right keyboard arrows
- free draw with mouse then using arrows carries on from mouse point
- change colour of the lines, previous colours stay..
